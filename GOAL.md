# Goal: Whole-Memory Pilot and Dependency-Ready Mnemosyne Continuation

## Objective

Continuously advance the authoritative Mnemosyne program from this dedicated
GoalEx worktree. First land and implement the smallest trustworthy whole-memory
reference-harness pilot authorized by the owner-landed hardened specification
and implementation plan. After that pilot is merged and exact-head CI is green,
reassess the canonical GSD roadmap and advance only the highest-value
dependency-ready, lease-disjoint source task.

GoalEx is the cross-task coordinator. RalphEx may execute one bounded round
under GoalEx, but RalphEx never selects the program direction.

## Authority

This goal does not create a second roadmap. Task status and dependency order
remain owned by:

- `.planning/STATE.md`
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/MILESTONES.md`
- approved repository plans and specifications
- live GitHub PR, review, and CI state

The whole-memory standard and pilot plan are executable authority on canonical
`main`. They were imported from verified clean handoff
`605ecd3ddf7faf308f664f0869e5e2eb431afa7d`; the first closed-ABI slice merged
by PR #79 at `a95fe4d291093253f8ce49adff32ba875a35e884`, and its bounded remediation
merged by PR #80 at `28805ccf54f99f098a5abc23fe6f1155400d0f22`:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-whole-memory-benchmark-standard-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-28-whole-memory-reference-harness-pilots.md`

Do not copy, edit, commit, stash, reset, or otherwise consume uncommitted work
from `/Users/admin/Mnemosyne.codex-whole-memory-benchmark-spec`. Do not touch
`/Users/admin/Mnemosyne.codex-phase16-signed-publication`; both are external
leases until their owners land or hand them off.

## Current Phase

**ABI slice and remediation delivered — M01/M10 harness integration next.**

WMBS-A/WMB-P1 authority, traceability, the closed common ABI, and fail-closed
reference validation landed at source head
`8d64f554c565edeb0c43868ff6d436e6e09df33a`; remediation head
`0d42f9436397a04e12ceaa3bdbd60d925e2640e9` merged by PR #80, and exact-merge
CI run `30484986865` passed on
`main@28805ccf54f99f098a5abc23fe6f1155400d0f22`. The next dependency-ready
slice is the fresh-main common-harness integration of the reviewed M01 and M10
development cores, followed by the narrow M03 valid-time slice and the
M01→M03→M10 replay path. Result-v2 remains blocked by the protected
signed-publication lease. The sandbox lane remains quarantined until it
provides real OCI, filesystem, network, and write-boundary enforcement.
Remaining receipts, measured cells, and module execution retain their existing
gates.

## Scope

Once the activation gate passes:

1. Reconcile the landed whole-memory standard against the current GSD state,
   roadmap, requirements, blueprint, PBPP, public harness, result-v1, ledger,
   custody, and publication contracts.
2. Execute the owner-approved pilot plan in dependency order with one active
   exact implementation lease at a time.
3. Prefer the smallest feasible pilot: closed ABI and validators, development
   sandbox/metering receipt, existing public-runner registration, and only the
   explicitly authorized M01/M03-valid-time/M10/M12/M13/M15/M20 development
   cells.
4. Preserve official-suite comparability and keep official, enhanced, and
   exploratory evidence separate.
5. After each normally merged round, refresh live `main`, GitHub gates, CBM,
   and durable Gbrain knowledge before selecting another task.
6. After the pilot is merged, continue only with the next dependency-ready
   source phase already present in the canonical GSD roadmap.

## Non-Goals

- No benchmark ranking, certification, superiority, launch, or production
  claim without held-out reproducible evidence and the required human approval.
- No official external benchmark substitution with synthetic or development
  fixtures.
- No production, hardware, custody, protected-dataset, paid-provider, or
  operator evidence fabrication.
- No publication, leaderboard activation, or result-v1 reinterpretation.
- No parallel benchmark lifecycle, runner, evidence store, result ledger, or
  roadmap.
- No Hermes fleet enablement and no direct writes to canonical `main`.
- No speculative implementation of all twenty modules.

## Approval and Operator Gates

The following remain blocked unless their owning canonical contract and human
operator supply the required evidence:

- Tier-B production validation and real-provider-forbid-local receipts.
- Protected or licensed dataset access and official external-suite execution.
- P32/H8 or other hardware-profile measurements.
- PBPP publication eligibility, signed custody, neutral/independent review
  labels, and public leaderboard activation.
- Any comparative or superiority claim.

An unavailable gate is recorded with its owner, missing evidence, and next safe
action. It is never widened, bypassed, averaged away, or relabeled as complete.

## Bounded Task-Selection Rules

For every GoalEx round:

1. Refresh canonical `main`, worktrees, dirty state, active tasks/processes,
   open PRs, reviews, CI, usage, and resource gates.
2. Reject any task that is dependency-blocked, operator-gated, leased, stale,
   broader than an approved plan, or merely housekeeping when substantive
   dependency-ready product or benchmark engineering exists.
3. Select exactly one highest-value task on an isolated Worktrunk branch with
   an explicit file lease. Preserve unowned dirty work and prevent redundant
   writers.
4. Apply Ponytail fully: reuse current contracts/code, then stdlib/platform,
   then installed dependencies; make the smallest tested root-cause change
   without speculative abstractions or dependencies.
5. Use context-mode for large output and resumable analysis. Refresh/query CBM
   before broad code reads, run impact analysis for risky diffs, and update ADRs
   only for genuine source-grounded architecture decisions.
6. Use GSD as lifecycle authority and only the relevant Superpowers checkpoint:
   approved design/planning, isolated worktrees, TDD, debugging, execution,
   review, verification, or branch completion.
7. Review trust boundaries, secrets, supply chain, failure modes, evidence
   language, and result compatibility. Push normally; require a PR, exact-head
   tests, review/thread/mergeability clearance, and post-merge `main` proof.
   Never force-push, bypass hooks, dismiss findings, or write directly to main.
8. After merge, safely fast-forward canonical local `main`, prove it equals
   clean `origin/main`, refresh CBM once, and sync one deduplicated durable
   Gbrain milestone rather than transient session facts.
9. Update only affected GSD state, plans, canonical docs, architecture/ADRs,
   benchmark contracts, and the real owner-discovered wiki. Never create a
   second wiki, roadmap, memory owner, or duplicate canonical content.
10. Self-repair routine transport, sandbox, CI, auth-independent, worktree, and
    review issues. Escalate only safety, authority, protected-environment, or
    product-direction decisions, then reassess the next lease-disjoint package.

## Runtime Contract

- Dedicated worktree:
  `/Users/admin/.codex/worktrees/9697/Mnemosyne`
- Branch: `codex/goalex-whole-memory-pilot`
- GoalEx planner/verifier: isolated derived launcher
  `.goalex/bin/goalex-sol` using `gpt-5.6-sol:low`.
- Bounded RalphEx plan, task, and review stages: `gpt-5.6-sol:low`.
- Claude/Fable planning, dual planning, dual review, and Hermes are disabled.
- Bounded guards: at most 20 rounds per process, three consecutive execution
  failures, three consecutive no-commit stalls, 15-minute idle timeout, and
  two-hour per-session timeout.
- Hermes fleet remains off.

## Success Evidence

Achieved for the closed-ABI slice and bounded remediation:

- owner-landed hardened specification and implementation plan;
- merged compound schema, reference validator, and focused contract fixtures;
- normal PR #79 review, exact-head CI, merge, and post-merge main proof.
- normal PR #80 remediation review, exact-head clearance, merge, exact-merge CI
  run `30484986865`, refreshed CBM, and a deduplicated Gbrain milestone.

The remaining whole-memory pilot milestone still requires:

- reviewed deterministic fixtures/generators, scorers, baselines,
  inferential plan, sandbox/metering contract, BOM/rights disclosures, resource
  receipts, and result-v1-compatible additive evidence contract;
- only honest development labels such as `PILOT-READY-DEV`,
  `publishable:false`, and `pbpp_headline_eligible:false`;
- focused and applicable full tests, Ruff, documentation/reference checks,
  security review, diff/lease/risky-file/secret checks;
- normal PR review, exact-head CI, merge, and exact post-merge main CI;
- refreshed CBM and a source-grounded Gbrain milestone.

The continuous program completes only when no approved dependency-ready source
task remains. Operator-gated work may remain blocked, but its owner and missing
evidence must be explicit.
